# Covert Communications Device

## UIUC ECE 445 Senior Design / Capstone Project

Won Best Engineered Project Award, and permanently listed in the [Hall of Fame](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece445/hall-of-fame.asp) for Spring 2021

## Abstract

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a means for safe and effective communication in highly sensitive military and law-enforcement operations.

It is important for a two-way channel of communication to exist between the base and individuals in the field. Regular communication tools have output which can disrupt sensory awareness of the user thereby rendering them unsuitable for information transmission in these situations. A wearable device thatrelays messages that are only detectable by the user, and that will not affect their focus is the purpose of this project.

The final output of this project is a small device that can be installed on the human body in a convenient location, such as the upper arm or the outer thigh. The user should be able to access the device using their hand. The device will transmit information to the user through the cadence of haptic feedback (vibration patterns). The user will also be able to transmit information to all other devices in near real-time using a button on the device (pressing the button with whatever cadence is required, e.g. long-short-short). Team selected codes can be established to effectively transmit complex information or instructions.
